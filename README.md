# concerts-wishlist
TypeScipt POC for Driven Bootcamp. Back-end of an app that allows music fans organize bands they want to see live or already did it. 

# about
<h3>Features</h3>

  * Add a band you saw live or want to see
  * Bands you already saw live must contain date and city when and where the concert happened and your rate (1 - 10) of it.
  * Update a concert you initially added as unwatched to watched
  * A user name must be provided for each band added
  * Delete a existent band concert
  * List all bands provided by a user

<h3>Motivation</h3>

  The project is initially a introduction and way to trainning Typescript, but, considering my passion for music and live concerts, is the beggining of a future bigger 
  project that can help people organize their dreams about live concerts and save the good memories about the ones wich are now reality.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

  Typescript, Node.js, Express, Joi and PostgreSQL.
